      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born in 1986 on a cold midwestern January. I spent most of my younger years in South Dakota and Texas. Looking for a change of pace, I moved to Seattle in 2010. I began my coding career in the CS department at North Seattle College. I decided after awhile that getting a four year degree part time was going to take too long. Shortly after making the decision to leave NSC, I discovered Code Fellows.</p>
